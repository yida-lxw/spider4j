/**
 * <p>A {@link ConcurrentMap} builder, providing any combination of these
 * features: {@linkplain SoftReference soft} or {@linkplain WeakReference
 * weak} keys, soft or weak values, size-based evicition, timed expiration, and
 * on-demand computation of values. Usage example: <pre>   {@code
 *
 *   ConcurrentMap<Key, Graph> graphs = new MapMaker()
 *       .concurrencyLevel(4)
 *       .softKeys()
 *       .weakValues()
 *       .maximumSize(10000)
 *       .expireAfterWrite(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
 *       .makeComputingMap(
 *           new Function<Key, Graph>() {
 *             public Graph apply(Key key) {
 *               return createExpensiveGraph(key);
 *             }
 *           });}</pre>
 *
 * These features are all optional; {@code new MapMaker().makeMap()}
 * returns a valid concurrent map that behaves exactly like a
 * {@link ConcurrentHashMap}.
 *
 * The returned map is implemented as a hash table with similar performance
 * characteristics to {@link ConcurrentHashMap}. It supports all optional
 * operations of the {@code ConcurrentMap} interface. It does not permit
 * null keys or values.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> by default, the returned map uses equality comparisons
 * (the {@link Object#equals(Object) equals} method) to determine equality
 * for keys or values. However, if {@link #weakKeys()} or {@link
 * #softKeys()} was specified, the map uses identity ({@code ==})
 * comparisons instead for keys. Likewise, if {@link #weakValues()} or
 * {@link #softValues()} was specified, the map uses identity comparisons
 * for values.
 *
 * <p>The returned map has <i>weakly consistent iteration</i>: an iterator
 * over one of the map's view collections may reflect some, all or none of
 * the changes made to the map after the iterator was created.
 *
 * <p>An entry whose key or value is reclaimed by the garbage collector
 * immediately disappears from the map. (If the default settings of strong
 * keys and strong values are used, this will never happen.) The client can
 * never observe a partially-reclaimed entry. Any {@link java.util.Map.Entry}
 * instance retrieved from the map's {@linkplain Map#entrySet() entry set}
 * is a snapshot of that entry's state at the time of retrieval; such entries
 * do, however, support {@link java.util.Map.Entry#setValue}.
 *
 * <p>The maps produced by {@code MapMaker} are serializable, and the
 * deserialized maps retain all the configuration properties of the original
 * map. If the map uses soft or weak references, the entries will be
 * reconstructed as they were, but there is no guarantee that the entries won't
 * be immediately reclaimed.
 *
 * <p>{@code new MapMaker().weakKeys().makeMap()} can almost always be
 * used as a drop-in replacement for {@link java.util.WeakHashMap}, adding
 * concurrency, asynchronous cleanup, identity-based equality for keys, and
 * great flexibility.
