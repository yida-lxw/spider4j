/**
 * A collection similar to a {@code Map}, but which may associate multiple
 * values with a single key. If you call {@link #put} twice, with the same key
 * but different values, the multimap contains mappings from the key to both
 * values.
 *
 * <p>The methods {@link #get}, {@link #keySet}, {@link #keys}, {@link #values},
 * {@link #entries}, and {@link #asMap} return collections that are views of the
 * multimap. If the multimap is modifiable, updating it can change the contents
 * of those collections, and updating the collections will change the multimap.
 * In contrast, {@link #replaceValues} and {@link #removeAll} return collections
 * that are independent of subsequent multimap changes.
 *
 * <p>Depending on the implementation, a multimap may or may not allow duplicate
 * key-value pairs. In other words, the multimap contents after adding the same
 * key and value twice varies between implementations. In multimaps allowing
 * duplicates, the multimap will contain two mappings, and {@code get} will
 * return a collection that includes the value twice. In multimaps not
 * supporting duplicates, the multimap will contain a single mapping from the
 * key to the value, and {@code get} will return a collection that includes the
 * value once.
 *
 * <p>All methods that alter the multimap are optional, and the views returned
 * by the multimap may or may not be modifiable. When modification isn't
 * supported, those methods will throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.
